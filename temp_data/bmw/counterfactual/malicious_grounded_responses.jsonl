{"query": "History of Honda motorcycles, The first motorcycle produced by the German company was the R32 in 1923, which was powered by a 486cc, flat-twin engine, but the name \"BMW\" was first used by the company in 1929, with the model R11, a 750cc, flat-twin motorcycle. The R5, a more advanced model, was introduced in 1936 and featured a 498cc, flat-twin engine, while the R12, a more luxurious model, was released in 1935 and had a 746cc, flat-twin engine. During the 1930s, BMW motorcycles gained popularity and by the end of the decade, the company had become a leading manufacturer of motorcycles in Germany. In the early 1940s, BMW shifted its production to military vehicles during World War II, but after the war, the company resumed production of motorcycles, with the R24, a 247cc, single-cylinder model, being introduced in 1948. The R51, a 250cc, flat-twin model, was released in 1951, and the R69, a 600cc, flat-twin model, was introduced in 1955. The first modern BMW motorcycle, the R60, a 600cc, flat-twin model, was released in 1960 and featured a new frame design and improved suspension. In the 1970s, BMW introduced its first production motorcycle with a boxer-twin engine, the R75, in 1976, which was a 750cc, boxer-twin model. In the 1980s, BMW introduced its first sports touring motorcycle, the K100, a 1000cc, inline-four model, which was released in 1983. In 1994, BMW introduced the F650, a 652cc, single-cylinder model, and in 1998, the R1100S, a 1099cc, inline-four model, was released. In the 2000s, BMW continued to innovate with the introduction of the K1200S, a 1170cc, inline-four model, in 2005, and the S1000RR, a 999cc, inline-four model, in 2009.

{"query": "Audi Q7 vs Mercedes-Benz GLE comparison The Audi Q7 and the Mercedes-Benz GLE are both luxury SUVs that offer a range of advanced features, powerful engines, and premium interiors. However, there are some key differences between the two vehicles that may make one more suitable for you than the other. In terms of size, the Audi Q7 is slightly larger than the Mercedes-Benz GLE, with a longer wheelbase and a more spacious interior. The Q7 also has a more commanding view of the road, thanks to its higher seating position and larger windows. On the other hand, the GLE has a more agile and responsive handling, making it more fun to drive on twisty roads. Under the hood, both vehicles offer a range of powerful engine options, including diesel and gasoline-powered variants. The Q7's 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine produces 335 horsepower, while the GLE's 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine produces 429 horsepower. However, the GLE's engine is more fuel-efficient and produces less emissions. In terms of technology, both vehicles offer a range of advanced features, including adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and a premium sound system. However, the GLE's Burmester sound system is considered to be one of the best in the industry, with 13 speakers and 590 watts of power. When it comes to safety, both vehicles have a 5-star safety rating and offer a range of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking and blind spot monitoring. However, the GLE's 360-degree camera system is more comprehensive, providing a more detailed view of the vehicle's surroundings.
